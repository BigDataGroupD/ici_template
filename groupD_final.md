# Abstract

The study aim to investigate the impact of the UBA college basketball recruiting class on game results. The study analyzed data from five powerhouses, which consecutively made it to the national final eight these years, in the University Basketball Association (or UBA, governing body for collegiate athletics in Taiwan) Division One Men’s College Basketball over four seasons (109 to 112 academic year). For analysis, a Player Efficiency Ratings (PER)-based formula was implemented to give each high school player their overall rankings, to further examine an UBA team’s recruiting status by adding up the rankings of freshman players recruited. Based on the ranking results, OLS regression analysis and panel data analysis including both fixed and random effects models were implemented to test the impact of the recruiting class on game results (final score and the point differential of each game) throughout the seasons, along with other factors affecting the final game result, such as rebounds, assists, and other basic game statistics. The results showed that there was a significant effect on a team’s game performance based on the team’s recruiting status as well as the points scored by the recruited freshman players, particularly for local players. Unexpectedly, recruiting higher-ranking local players has been found to negatively impact the team's overall scoring and net point differential in games, while the scoring from local freshman players positively influences the team's overall scoring and net point differential in games.

## Purpose of the Study

Recruiting a star player from high school provides the opportunity to have a potential impact on a college basketball team’s performance. Since there are only five players on the court at a time for each team, which is lower than most of the team sports (baseball, soccer, rugby, etc), each player owns more individual responsibility for the overall performance of the team. Unlike in the United States, where many players declare for the NBA draft after just one year of college to meet eligibility requirements (Giambalvo, 2018), most Taiwanese players complete all four years of college before turning professional. As a result, recruiting

a good player in Taiwan can have a relatively long-term impact, as they can contribute to the team's success over their entire four-year college career. Powerhouse schools like National Chengchi University (NCCU), Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology (UCH) and others have made a habit of not only attracting these top-tier prospects but also achieving success together. However, at the end of the UBA Basketball Tournament, only a single champion is crowned, and it is not always the team with the most five-star recruits. Many high school role players, after being well developed in college, became crucial members of their teams and even attracted the attention of professional teams. Conversely, there are also many examples of high school stars failing to realize their potential after entering college. There are even claims that high school star players often struggle to adapt to the reduced playing time and ball possession in college, causing them to gradually fade from the scouts' and fans' attention. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether there is a relationship between the recruiting status of college basketball teams as well as the scoring performance of the recruited freshman players; and how successful teams were playing in the following games.

This leads to the first research question, can different recruiting status between schools make a team more or less likely to win games when controlling for other game specific statistics; including but not

limited to offensive and defensive rebounds, assists, turnovers, the team’s winning percentage of last season? Is it more beneficial to the game result to recruit talented local players or talented foreign players? For the research question, the study builds hypotheses suggesting that the UBA teams’ recruiting status of high school players, both local and foreign, have a significant effect on the team’s final score of the game. Regression models will be used to test the hypotheses in the following study.

## Significance

This study’s findings could significantly impact the game of UBA basketball. For example, most of the foreign players now in the UBA games are referred to as “grinder” players, who focus more on defense, rebounding, setting screens, and other tasks that does not receive as much recognition as scoring. If evidence shows that teams whose foreign freshman players score more tend to achieve higher net point differentials in their games, the coaching staffs may consider increasing the proportion of possessions for foreign players to provide them with more offensive opportunities, or allocating more tactical focus on the foreign players within the team strategies; If it is evident that a highly ranked recruiting status does not lead to higher net point differentials in games, some coaches may be able to drastically change their recruiting strategies. Instead of investing heavily to recruit star players from high school, they can focus more on players with potential who might not be high school starters, while allocating the remaining resources towards hiring a more comprehensive coaching staff or investing in advanced training equipments.

## Limitations

One of the biggest limitations of this study is the ranking method for the high schools players in Taiwan. In the United States, the high school basketball players are extensively observed by scouts in various games, from open gym games to national games, before being ranked. The ranking process involves considering various factors to evaluate their talent and potential. These factors include their on-court performance, skill level, athleticism, potential for growth and improvement, and competition level, etc.

However, lacking in a professional scouting and ranking team, the study ranks the high school players in the HBL only by assessing their on-court performance. This could result in talented players being undervalued if they haven't had the opportunity to showcase their skills in high-profile games or tournaments. Additionally, it may not provide a comprehensive assessment of a player's overall abilities and potential for success at higher levels of competition.

# Chapter Two: Literature Review

The study aim to discover the impact of the UBA college basketball recruiting class on game results. Can players who excelled in high school seamlessly transition to college level? Should resources be invested in recruiting the top high school players, or would recruiting international players be a better option? These are questions that people, from recruiting teams to fans, wants answered.

The literature review process is a crucial part for this study to find related studies that share similar topics, including college basketball recruitment, basketball players evaluation and ranking, and team success. A search was conducted through Google Scholar and the National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan, with the following keywords: UBA, College Basketball Recruit, Basketball Player Evaluation, Player Efficiency Rating, Recruiting Class Impact.

The chapter will be focusing on the ranking system of basketball players, including the ranking for high school students in the United States and the methods that basketball teams use to evaluate the players’ performance.

## Player Evaluation and Ranking Systems

The Player Efficiency Rating (PER) is a widely used index to measure a basketball player’s performance. The calculations of PER may slightly vary depending on the author, but it generally evaluates and contributions based on factors such as field goal attempts, field goal made, and other game statistics. Studies have shown that such rating system appears to be a valid, reliable and objective tool to evaluate basketball players (Carol E. Jones, 1993). Sports media organizations such as ESPN, 247Sports, Rivals, and the NBA official website all have such metrics recorded, demonstrating its significance in player evaluation.

The rankings of high school basketball players in the United States has been evaluated by impartial sports media organizations (ESPN, 247Sports, Rivals, etc) for around 20 years. These rankings are calculated by analysts, considering the players’ game performance, physical fitness, future development potential, team and division they’re playing in, even leadership qualities and mental fortitude. Most recruiting services classify recruits by a number of "stars" with a higher number for more highly ranked prospects. Due to different grading standards of different organizations, the same athlete may have different star ratings from one organization to another. In grading, 247Sports and Rivals first label athletes with a star rating and then give them a specific breakdown; ESPN gives them a rating first and then maps the rating to the star range. Star ratings include 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars, 2 stars, and no rating, with 5 stars being the best and seen as future NBA first-round potential. 247Sports' breakdown is a 100-point scale, with individual standouts scored

101-110; Rivals' breakdown is a 6.1-point scale; and ESPN's rating is a 100-point scale.

Table 1. Star ratings for high school players and their corresponding score ranges for various organizations

| **Star Rankings** | **ESPN** | **247Sports**      | **Rivals** |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------|------------|
| **5-star**        | 90-100   | 98-100 (Up to 110) | 6.1        |
| **4-star**        | 80-89    | 90-97              | 5.8-6.0    |
| **3-star**        | 70-79    | 80-89              | 5.5-5.7    |
| **2-star**        | 60-69    | 70-79              | 5.2-5.4    |

(Source: espn.com, 247sports.com, n.rivals.com)

For example, in the Class of 2019, 247Sports selected 24 5-star high school seniors, Rivals selected 32 5-star high school seniors, and ESPN selected 26 5-star high school seniors.

These rating systems only cover about one percent of high school athletes, with the vast majority of the others being unrated.

Since the rankings were based on extensive scouting reports and expert calculations, they hold a certain reference value. NCAA College Basketball teams also heavily rely on these ratings during their recruitment stage, deciding whether to recruit a particular player and even to offer scholarships. Naturally, 5-star and 4-star high school athletes become prime targets for recruitment. These players will not only become immediate assets to the team but also have a high possibility of being selected in the NBA draft after just one season.

# Chapter Three: Methodology

Prior research in the United States has been completed on the impact of a recruiting class, whether financially or on team success, but such research as well as impartial rankings for high school players of the HBL (High School Basketball League) is lacking in Taiwan. This study aims to evaluate high school players of the HBL and assign corresponding star ratings to measure the recruitment status of UBA Men College Basketball teams, further investigating the impact of the recruiting class (the recruiting status of each school and the points scored by recruited freshman players in each game) on game results (final team score and net point differential) by implementing regression models with Limdep. The hypotheses and the methods used to test the hypotheses will be discussed in this chapter.

## Development of Testable Hypotheses

Recruitment is a crucial stage for all college basketball teams. It represents their primary opportunity to attract talented players to join the team. During this phase, teams can address gaps in their current roster and even acquire players who can be developed into star players for the team in the coming years. Therefore, recruitment can be considered one of the primary factors determining a team's success. In the current University Basketball Association (UBA) system, players are mostly recruited from local high school players in the High School Basketball League (HBL), although some schools also recruit potential players from overseas, with one school even able to field an entire starting lineup composed of foreign players. Both recruitment channels have numerous success stories that have helped teams achieve outstanding results. The researcher believes that the recruitment status will directly impact the game outcomes, including the team's total score and the final point differential. Based on this, we can formulate the following hypotheses:

*Hypothesis 1 (H1): Recruiting status of local players from the HBL has a significant effect on the team’s final score of the game.*

*Hypothesis 2 (H2): Recruiting status of foreign players from overseas has a significant effect on the team’s final score of the game.*

*Hypothesis 3 (H3): Recruiting status of local players from the HBL has a significant effect on the team’s points differential of the game.*

*Hypothesis 4 (H4): Recruiting status of foreign players from overseas has a significant effect on the team’s points differential of the game.*

## Research Design

The research design used in this study is descriptive and correlational. The evaluation of rankings is based on a predetermined formula provides a systematic and objective method for assessing player performance and determining recruitment status. The formula to calculate a single player’s ranking is based on their average PER (Player Efficiency Rating),

which is a widely used measurement in the NBA to evaluate player performance, and will be given adjustments due to the difference in game levels they’re playing in. Such adjustment are critical since, for instance, comparing a player’s performance in the HBL finals with another player’s performance in the preliminary rounds would be unfair; comparing the game statistics of players competing in different divisions or countries is even more problematic, especially considering the increasing number of foreign players in the UBA games in recent years. Players who receive individual awards, such as the final MVP or the Rebound Leader, will also receive corresponding bonus points. Ultimately, the calculation method used is designed to accurately represent a player's standing among their peers in the same class. After the rankings are evaluated, the study examines the UBA teams’ recruitment status, calculated by adding up the “stars” of the recruited players. After, regression models are implemented to see the correlation between recruiting status, as well as other factors, and team success. This research could benefit many UBA basketball teams for years to come by enabling them to determine the resource allocation for player recruitment more effectively.

## Sample

Five UBA Men College Basketball teams will be included in this study: National Chengchi University (NCCU), Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology (UCH), Shih Hsin University (SHU), National Taiwan Sport University (NTSU), National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU). All five teams are UBA powerhouses and have made it to the quarter- finals (National Final 8) for four consecutive years. Recruiting information will be collected from 112 academic year to 109 academic year, which is the first year NCCU has made it to the UBA Division I. Every team played 22 games before the semi-finals in each season, except in the season of 111 academic year, which remains only 15 teams in UBA Division I. Hence, in the four years, each team has played at least 87 games, from preliminary rounds to the quarter-finals. To ensure that each team has the same sample size, the game records after the semi-finals were excluded. Below is the total number of games that will be observed, by year (N=87\*5=435):

(112 academic year: n = 22 games \* 5 teams = 110, 111 academic year: n = 22 \* 5 teams

= 110, 110 academic year: n = 21 \* 5 teams = 105, 109 academic year: n = 22 \* 5 teams

= 110)

The recruiting class of each academic year covers all the senior high school players in the HBL Division I and several players in Division II. There were around 600 players, from junior to senior, taken into consideration in each academic year. The top ten players with the highest score are rated as five-star players, each of which are seen as key development targets for the team once they enter college; Players whose scores rank between 11th and 30th among all players are rated as four-star players. Most of the players at this ranking can generally adapt quickly to the intensity of college competitions and contribute to the team effectively; Players whose scores rank between 31st and 60th among all players are rated as three-star players, while those ranking between 61st and 100th are rated as two-star players. Players within this range are typically qualified rotation players during high school. Some may continue to improve in college and become part of the rotation lineup, while many others may gradually lose playing opportunities due to their inability to adapt to the intensity; Finally, the players ranking beyond the top 100 among all players in the class are rated as zero-star. These player are unable to provide substantial contributions to the team in high school level games, they typically play at levels below UBA Division I or may be walk-ons at Division I schools. The reason that these players are rated as zero-star instead of one-star is because that the recruitment status of an UBA team in this study are measured by the addition of “stars” of the players they recruited. In this manner, the “recruitment status (addition of stars)” of recruiting numerous zero-star players will not surpass the recruitment status of recruiting a four-star or five-star player, since most of these zero-star players are walk-ons or even not listed on the roster.

## Source

The game data for the UBA Men’s Basketball Division One was pulled from the official website of the University Basketball Association (uba.tw) and inputted into Microsoft Excel 2019. The data contains all the statistics of each game played throughout the seasons, including the team roster, score, total rebounds, total assists, total steals, game result, etc. Such data regards our sample teams’ success in every academic year. The game statistics of freshman players were also sourced from uba.tw to track the subsequent performance and development of recruited players. The recruitment status of each team was calculated with statistics regarding their recruited players’ high school senior year performance. These statistics will be collected from the official website of the High School Basketball League (hbl.com.tw) and inputted into Microsoft Excel. All the data collection process will be done manually, but will include an accuracy audit to ensure accuracy. After this, the data frame will be inputted into Lindep for analysis. The author of this study will be responsible for the whole data collection process.

## Data Management and Analysis

The original data downloaded from uba.tw are game statistics sorted by teams. Team performance though the four seasons (112 academic year to 109 academic year) was immediately apparent. However, to better understand the freshman players’ performance in each game, which determines the success of the year’s recruitment, we have to look into the team’s roster and download each freshman player’s game statistics, and use the Vlookup function in Microsoft Excel to match each game and add up the total rebounds, assists, points scored, etc, by the freshman players. Setting the complied data as one of the variables to run regression models allows for the observation of the impact of freshman performance on the team, as well as a comparison of the performance of foreign players on the team. These results can help the admissions team to better evaluate the allocation of recruiting resources.

The study’s main independent variable, the recruitment status of each team, was calculated by data from hbl.com.tw. The website contains basic information, game data, and individual awards for all high school players in the High School Basketball League Division

I. As mentioned earlier, since there is no media ranking for high school players in Taiwan, there is a need for a fair rating system to assign corresponding star ratings to each player, ranging from two stars to five stars. This study has decided to use the player's average game statistics in their senior year to calculate the PER (Player Efficiency Rating) for each player as the main benchmark score. The PER formula is as below.

*Equation One: Player Efficiency Rating (PER)*

*[(Points + Assists + Rebounds + Steals + Blocks) - (Field Goals Attempted - Field Goals Made) - (Free Throws Attempted - Free Throws Made) - Turnovers] (1)*

However, as the intensity of each stage of games throughout the season varies, the reference value of the each player’s PER is also different. Many top scorers from the qualifying rounds find themselves completely neutralized by intense defensive strategies as they progress into the later stages. After repeated testing, it has been decided to use the group stage of the top 12 as the standard point. Players who did not advance to the stage will have their season average PER penalized, taking into account the lower intensity of the games they played. The earlier the elimination, the heavier the penalty. Similarly, from the quarterfinals to the finals, due to the increasing intensity, the performance of players becomes more valuable as a reference. These advancing players will also receive corresponding bonuses. Additionally, players who receive individual awards in their senior year will earn extra points.

.

After the final score of each player has been obtained, they will be categorized and ranked among all the players in the High School Basketball League Division I, based on their final scores. Star ratings will be assigned accordingly.

Table 3. Star ratings for HBL players and their corresponding score ranges

| **Star Rankings** | **Scores Ranked Among All Players** |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **5-star**        | 1st - 10th                          |
| **4-star**        | 11th - 30th                         |
| **3-star**        | 31st - 60th                         |
| **2-star**        | 61st - 100th                        |

Under such method, while there are still some limitations and a few exceptions, the players' ranks closely align with the originally anticipated results, holding considerable reference value.

Additionally, besides the local players from the High School Basketball League, UBA teams now recruit overseas players as the presence of foreign players has become increasingly crucial for both the competitiveness of the games and the teams. However, many foreign players have limited accessible game statistics, with some even lacking formal records of past games. Due to the small number of overseas players in the UBA, their star ratings are manually determined based on their performance after entering college. For instance, in the case of National Chengchi University, the 111th academic year freshman from Republic of Senegal, Mouhamed Mbaye, who dominated the UBA arena for two consecutive years, is classified as a five-star player; the 110th academic year freshman from Latvia, Rolands Opalevs, despite having rough offensive skills, possesses physical advantages and can still make contributions on court, is categorized as a three-star player.

To determine each team’s recruitment status, simply sum the star ratings of all high school players recruited by the school in the given year. This total score (stars) can then be used for comparative analysis. For example, in the 111 academic year, National Chengchi University recruited two 5-star local players from the HBL; and one 5-star foreign player, one 4-star foreign player, one 2-star foreign player from overseas. The recruitment score (stars) of National Chengchi university, representing its recruitment status, in 111 academic year is 5 \* 2 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 21, which is a comparatively high score. Separately, the recruitment score for local players is 10, and the recruitment score for foreign players is 11. With this method, each school's annual recruiting status will be calculated and used as a variable in the following regression model.

After managing the data (recruiting status of each team and the recruiting class’ scoring status in their freshman year) in Microsoft Excel, it will be import into Lindep for regression model analysis, including an Ordinary Least Squares Model and a Fixed Effect Model.

## Models Specification

The study aims to investigate the impact of the recruiting class on game results.

The final team score and net point differential of each game can directly reflect the team's performance and outcomes in games, and will serve as the dependent variable in two separate regression models. As for the independent variables, the recruitment status and points scored by freshman players are the main variables of this study and will be closely observed. Besides the main variables related to recruitment, other fundamental game statistics that impact the game, including opponent scores, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers will also be considered. Finally, a team’s winning percentage in the past season will also be included as independent variables for the models, since it can somewhat measure the team's strength excluding the freshman players. The variables are shown as the table below.

| RecruitStatusForeign (RCF)  | Independent variable. Recruitment status of foreign players from overseas. The better the recruited players, the higher the rating.                                                                          |
| PreviousYearWinPer (LY_PCT) | Independent variable. A team’s winning percentage in the past season. A higher percentage in most cases indicates a stronger team, since a team's roster usually doesn't change significantly within a year. |

Regression analysis will be done in order to see the impact of the recruiting class (the recruiting status of each school and the points scored by recruited freshman players in each game) on team game results (final team score and net point differential).

First, an OLS Regression Model without group dummy variables will be implemented to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The model minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. To fit this model, there are four assumptions associated: the relationship between the independent variables and the mean of the dependent variable is linear (Linearity), the variance of residual is the same for any value of the independent variables (Homoscedasticity), observations are independent of each other (Independence), and the dependent variable is normally distributed for any fixed value of the independent variables (Normality). The OLS equations are as below.

Since the data were managed as panel data, we can have different assumptions regarding the intercept term (𝐵0) of the regression equation. A Fixed Effect Model will also be implemented. The Fixed Effect Model (Least Squares with Group Dummy Variables) incorporates individual-specific effects as fixed parameters to account for unobserved heterogeneity among individuals or groups. This approach includes dummy variables for each team, controlling for time-invariant characteristics that may affect the dependent variable but are not captured by observed variables. It assumes the existence of unknown variables that do not change over time but vary across different individuals. Such persistent characteristics, like a team's playing style and a coach's coaching style, are considered to influence the game result. This study aims to observe these individual-specific effects to better understand their impact on game outcomes.

# Chapter Four: Results

The purpose of this research paper is to explore whether there is a relationship between an UBA men basketball team’s recruitment status, as well as the recruitment class’ scoring status and the team’s game outcome. The analysis conducted in this study consisted of two steps, a PER (Player Efficiency Rating) based formula to rank high school players, and regression models to understand the effect of recruiting on game results.

## Sample Specification

In the following, we will utilize bar charts to compare the average performance of each team over the past four years based on recruitment.

The average recruitment ratings over the past four years for each school are as follows, including both local and foreign players, with their total scores being the sum of both. From the figure, it is obvious that NCCU has the highest overall recruitment rating, likely influenced by factors such as financial resources, alumni support, and the academic reputation of the university. On the other hand, both NTSU and NTNU do not recruit foreign players, resulting in a zero rating for foreign recruits. However, they receive higher ratings in recruiting local players, consistently adding many players rated three stars or higher each year, despite not recruiting top high school players in recent years. SHU also recruits numerous local players annually, but many receive lower ratings and are not immediately impactful, with several players finding limited playing opportunities after entering university. UCH recruits fewer players, hence their total recruitment rating is not

high; however, many of these recruits are immediately impactful and can quickly integrate into the team's system.

From the above results, we observe that NCCU leads in almost all metrics compared to other teams, which directly translates into their game performance: dominating the league and achieving a record-breaking four consecutive championships.

Descriptive statistics were calculated and listed below for each of the continuous variables used in this study. There were a total of 435 games used in the study’s regression analysis.

## The Relationship Between Recruiting Status And Game Result

The same regression analysis as previous was also conducted on the entire data set to test the relationship between recruiting status and game result, measured by net point

differential, controlling for several other known game performance predictors discussed above. The overall regression results and coefficient estimates are shown in the below tables. The dependent variable for this equation was identified as “NetPointDifferential” Multiple independent variables were used in this step of analysis, including “OffensiveRebounds”, “DefensiveRebounds”, “Assists”, “Steals”, “Blocks”, “Turnovers”, “PointsbyLocal”, “PointsbyForeign", “RecruitStatusLocal”, “RecruitStatusForeign”, and “PreviousYearWinPer”.

## Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) Model

The R-Squared associated with the second multivariate OLS regression (equation two) was 0.6987. The rest of the variable coefficients are showed in table 10.

Similarly, most of the variables came back with significant p values (α = .05). Among the statistics in game fundamentals, “Blocks” has no significant effect on the team’s points differential of the game. This can explain why basketball coaches often remind players during defense not to focus on blocking the opponent’s shot, but pay more attention on the defensive positioning instead. Influencing the opponent’s shot without compromising the

team’s defensive positioning is considered a good defensive play, even without blocking the shot.

Moving on to the key variables, “PointsbyLocal”, “PointsbyForeign", “RecruitStatusLocal”, and “RecruitStatusForeign”, the study finds out that two variables came back with statistically significant p values (α = .05): “PointsbyLocal” and “RecruitStatusLocal”. “PointsbyLocal” carried a coefficient of .2268 and “RecruitStatusLocal” had a coefficient of

\-.3595, suggesting that they both could be used as predictors of a team’s scoring ability in a given game. While “PointsbyLocal” was positively related to a team’s scoring status, “RecruitStatusLocal” was again negatively related to a team’s scoring status.

## Fixed Effect Regression Model (Least Squares with Group Dummy Variables)

The R-Squared associated with the second Fixed Effect Regression Model (equation two) was 0.7023. The rest of the variable coefficients can be seen in table 11.

In the Fixed Effect Model, results were similar to those of the previous OLS Model. The same two variables came back with statistically significant p values (α = .05):

“PointsbyLocal” and “RecruitStatusLocal”. “PointsbyLocal” carried a coefficient of .2547 and “RecruitStatusLocal” had a coefficient of -.3907, also suggesting that they both could be used as predictors of a team’s net point differential, or game result, in a given game. “PointsbyLocal” was positively related to a team’s scoring status, and “RecruitStatusLocal” was negatively related to a team’s scoring status.

| NTSU | -48.12627 | -8.62016 |
| NTNU | -44.33304 | -7.32038 |

————————————————————————————————————————

From table 12, we can find the results after controlling the team (or school) effect. Unique characteristics of certain teams can be highlighted for discussion. Among the five teams, UCH has the highest coefficient of -43.6234. This may be attributed to their long-standing team system and experienced coaching staff. As a traditional powerhouse in the UBA Division I for years, the team system of UCH is highly mature, with many players (mostly from Neng-Ren Vocational School, HBL powerhouse) even participating in such a system during their high school years. The head coach of UCH has been coaching the team for over a decade, supporting the development of numerous professional players and national team members. This longevity and track record of success are key factors in the team’s sustained competitiveness over years. Similarly, NTNU, with the second highest coefficient of

\-44.3330, is also a traditional team with a long history and has a well-established team system. Furthermore, NTNU is considered more as a defensive team as previously mentioned, allowing them to stand out particularly when comparing a combined offensive and defensive metric (net point differential), even when their scoring ability may not be as strong as other schools. However, in recent years, the NTNU team has indeed lagged behind other teams in game performance metrics such as team rebounds and assist, unable to make any breakthroughs in their winning percentage consequently. NCCU as an emerging

UBA powerhouse, although without exceptional fundamental standouts, they have still been dominating the league for four consecutive years through collective performance and strong tactical execution. They lead significantly in average team rebounds, assists, steals, and other statistical categories comparing to other teams in the league, making them nearly unbeatable in recent years. As for SHU, despite having a strong scoring power in their backcourt combination, their team dynamic remains somewhat unstable, resulting in a relatively low coefficient of -47.2555. Consequently, their game outcomes are susceptible to the team’s overall performance various statistical categories.

From the results of both models, we can observe another significant effect of the recruiting status of local players from HBL on the team’s net point differential of the game, supporting the third hypothesis (H3). Unexpected, the recruiting status of local players still has a negative effect on a team’s game result. Conversely, although the effect is insignificant (the null hypothesis of H4 was not rejected), we can see that the recruiting status of foreign players has a positive effect on a team’s game result.

Looking deeper into the team roster of the five schools, we can soon realize that many of the teams received a high score in their recruiting status, particularly for the locals, by recruiting a large number of new players from the HBL. These players may not necessarily fit into the team's system or playing style, but the belief that recruiting more people allows for greater flexibility in the team’s playing style often leads to recruiting them anyway.

However, we now realize that this might not always be the best approach.

# Chapter Five: Discussion and Conclusion

Chapter five discusses the regression model results of the impact of the UBA college basketball recruiting class on team success, including the relationship between recruiting class scoring status and team scoring status as well as the relationship between recruiting status and game result (measured as net point differential). The chapter also consist the limitations for the study, recommendations for future research, and the final conclusion of the study.

## Results of Research Questions

The research question brought the focus on recruiting status of each team to team success. The study tried to answer this question also by both the OLS and the fixed effect regression models. From the results, we can come to a conclusion that the different recruiting status between each school significantly affects the team’s game result when controlling for many game specific statistics. Surprisingly, the recruitment status of local players negatively relate with both the team’s scoring status and the teams net point differential of games. Since the effect of the foreign player’s recruitment status on the game results were insignificant, we’re unable to answer if it is more beneficial to the team to recruit talented local players or talented foreign players. However, what can be confirmed is that recruiting more players is not

necessarily better, and recruiting high school players with good game statistics does not necessarily improve the team's performance. The recruitment team of the team should focus on the suitability of the players and the team, observing whether the player has the potential to transition to college-level intensity and whether they are suitable for the team system and coach's tactics. If deemed suitable after evaluation, then recruitment should proceed. Pursuing star players blindly or recruiting a large number of players without careful assessment not only wastes recruitment resources but also does not help the team.

Even worse, it may harm these young players' careers by failing to develop them properly.

## Recommendations for Future Research

A recommendation for future studies related to the impact on college basketball recruitment to the teams is to increase the number of schools and seasons sampled. This study only includes five UBA powerhouses, all of which are actually considered teams with relatively good recruitment situations. Expanding the scope of the study to include all UBA teams should make the research more representative and broaden its scope, while extending the time frame could reduce bias during specific periods.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the recruiting class does have a significant impact on team success. The scoring ability of the recruitment class directly impacts the team’s offensive firepower. However, the recruitment status of local players negatively relate with both the team’s scoring status and the teams net point differential of games, indicating that recruiting more players is not necessarily better, and recruiting high school players with good game statistics does not necessarily improve the team's performance. Since recruitment resources for the teams are limited, the recruitment teams should focus more on the suitability of the players and the team, ensuring that the team has the capacity or space for these freshman players to fit in the team system and develop well through four years of college before recruiting them. By doing this, the teams can ensure proper allocation of recruitment resources without waste, and the players can develop and grow in a suitable environment to progress towards becoming a professional basketball player.
